# Vitual-Assistant-Doraemon
This is a basic virtual assistant whom I named as 'Doraemon' using the importing of 'wolframalpha' and 'wikipedia' modules , both of 'worlframalpha' and 'wikipedia' will search over the internet for data and return the searched keyword back to you .

What it can do ?
* it can act like a simple calculator both scientific and advanced.
* it returns the details of the entered keyword


speech recognition will be updated soon...:heart:
